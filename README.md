## Gameplay:
## Basic Rules
1. Players take turns to move their coins on the digital game board.
2. Each coin can move to an adjacent space that is free (unoccupied by any coin). The movement is limited to one step at a time, meaning a coin can only be moved to a neighbouring, unoccupied space.
3. The goal is to capture the opponent's coins by strategically surrounding them and blocking their possible moves.

## Capturing Opponent's Coins
A coin is considered captured when all its possible moves are blocked. Once a player captures three of their opponent's coins, they are declared the winner. Here is a representation of how to capture opponent coins.

## Suicide Move Alert
The game includes a feature that detects and alerts players from making "suicide moves." A suicide move is when a player mistakenly makes a move that captures their own coin. The game will notify the player of this error, allowing them to rectify their move.

## Winning the Game
The first player to capture three of their opponent's coins is the winner of the game. The game ends immediately when this condition is met.

## Strategies:
1. Blocking Opponent's Moves: Focus on strategically positioning your coins to block your opponent's potential moves. Preventing them from making any valid moves is the key to capturing their coins.
2. Cornering Opponent's Coins: Corners are valuable positions on the board. Try to corner your opponent's coins, limiting their mobility and increasing your chances of capturing them.
3. Maintain Mobility: While it's crucial to block your opponent, ensure that your own coins have room to move. Staying mobile allows you to react to your opponent's actions and maintain control of the game.
4. Control the Center: The central regions of the board are pivotal for controlling the game. Dominating these areas can help you exert more influence over the board and your opponent.
5. Mind Your Turn Order: The player going first has a slight advantage. Use your initial moves wisely to create favourable positions on the board.
